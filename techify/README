=======================================Introduction==================================
We have come up with a solution to aid Indian farmers as they constitute large proportion of Jio Phone users in India.
1. This application will help them gain required information through a QnA portal which will be answered by general public and their answers will be prioritized according to the likes of the readers. 

2. Borrow/Loaning the agricultural hardwares required for effective agricultural activities like harvesting, plowing, etc. This may be helpful as not everyone is fortunate enough to buy each and every hardware, and this pooling of hardwares will really ease the burden off them.
